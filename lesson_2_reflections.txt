1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    The folder is now tracked by git and changes can be committed and reversed
    if necessary.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
    The staging area allows you to queue up the files to be included in a
    commit. It allows you to separate commits logically as needed.
