1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    The folder is now tracked by git and changes can be committed and reversed
    if necessary.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
    The staging area allows you to queue up the files to be included in a
    commit. It allows you to separate commits logically as needed.

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
 change?
    I can limit the files being committed to logical groups.

4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized?
    If I needed to work on a new feature or bug fix I could create a branch
    to accomplish this in both situations.
