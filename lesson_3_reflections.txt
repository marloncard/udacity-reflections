1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I would use a remote repository to collaborate with others, backup a local repository
  or share open source code.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    Depending on my goals I might not need all changes currently on the remote
    repository or I might want to review the changes before adding them to my
    local copy.
