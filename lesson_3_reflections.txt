1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I would use a remote repository to collaborate with others, backup a local repository
  or share open source code.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    Depending on my goals I might not need all changes currently on the remote
    repository or I might want to review the changes before adding them to my
    local copy.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?
    Forks are actually a type of clone used only on GitHub. I would use to
    clone a repository from another GitHub account to my mine.
    Clones are simply git copies of a repository. I would "clone" a local
    repository or a remote repo to my local computer.
    Branches are labeled versions of a repo created to fix errors, create new
    features or experiment.
